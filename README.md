# taurus

An stock exchange simulator based on the FIX protocol. It accepts buy/sell orders
and matches them. Execution Reports are sent back to the buy-side application.
It's quite basic, I just needed something to talk to my order management application
for testing purposes. 

## Usage

Update the fix.cfg file and run the app. Pass the location of the config file as argument
